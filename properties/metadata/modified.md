# modified

## Definition
The timestamp at which this data was last modified (as opposed to the the "timestamp" metadata property that records when it was created or processed.)

## Values
This property stores a timestamp when the scouting data is last modified using the number of milliseconds since the Unix timestamp.

## Examples
- 1711728192000
- 1711729092182

## Design Recommendation
This property does not need an associated user input as it can be determined automatically by the scouting app.
