# timestamp

## Definition
The timestamp metadata represents the client-side timestamp when the scouting data is submitted (if applicable) or otherwise finalized.

## Values
This property stores a timestamp when the scouting data is submitted (if applicable) or otherwise finalized.  It is in Unix time format (the number of milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.)

## Examples
- 1711728192000

## Design Recommendation
This property does not need an associated user input as it can be determined automatically by the scouting app.
