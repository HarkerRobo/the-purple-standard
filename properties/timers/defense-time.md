# defense-time

## Definition
The defense-time timer represents the time a robot spends performing defensive maneuvers during the match.

## Values
This property stores an integer value of milliseconds based on the time a robot spends performing defensive maneuvers.

## Examples
- 100
- 1000
- 5000

## Design Recommendation
This property can be implemented as a timer, where a user can start and stop the timer whenever the robot is performing defensive maneuvers. Although not recommended, this property could alternatively be implemented as a numerical input box, where a user can provide an estimation of the number of milliseconds spent performing defensive maneuvers.
