# What is TPS

The Purple Standard (TPS) is a unified, community-driven standard for FRC scouting data. After working with 140+ teams who scouted collaboratively with us on The Purple Warehouse (TPW) last year, we realized that many of you still couldn't enjoy the benefits of collaborative scouting because of different scouting interfaces that collect data using incompatible formats. We were able to work with several teams to manually write reformatting scripts, converting their data to our app's format so that they could contribute to and access TPW's pool of shared scouting data. From our experiences this past season working with many different incompatible scouting data formats, we want to propose a better solution.

The goal of TPS is to provide a flexible and consistent data format for scouting to allow any team to easily share scouting data regardless of which interface is used. We hope this will strengthen the FRC scouting ecosystem by allowing more teams to share and receive scouting data which can be corroborated to provide more accurate analysis and insights while requiring less reliance (and pressure) on individual teams. In 2023, we saw that collaborative scouting through TPW significantly helped smaller teams and rookies who weren't able to scout as many matches individually but could still access a fuller picture of the overall event's scouting data by working together.

# How to Collect Specific Data

The goal of TPS is to be completely flexible and customizable regardless of what each scouting app is collecting. None of the properties are required, and if you want to collect data that doesn't yet exist in the TPS properties, you can simply open a PR for it! The hope is that app developers can look at TPS, see if properties exist that they are collecting (and if so, use the existing format to maintain interoperability), and if those properties don't exist, they can simply contribute them to the repo.

# How to Contribute to a Shared Pool of Data

We will be releasing a set of APIs as well as an intuitive JavaScript SDK to make it easier for app developers to share TPS scouting data across apps. Make sure to join our [Discord server](https://thepurplewarehouse.com/discord) to stay up-to-date on future developments!
